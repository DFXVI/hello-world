# hello-world

a short description.

I close my eyes, tell us why must we suffer?
Release your hands, for your will drags us under
My legs grow tired, tell us where must we wander?
How can we carry on, if redemption's beyond us?

To all of my children in whom life flows abundant
To all of my children to whom death hath passed his judgement
The soul yearns for honor, and the flesh the hereafter
Look to those who walked before to lead those who walk after

Shining is the land's light of justice
Ever flows the land's well of purpose
Walk free
Walk free
Walk free
Believe
The land's alive, so believe...

Now open your eyes, while our plight is repeated
Still deaf to our cries, lost in hope we lie defeated
Our souls have been torn, and our bodies forsaken
Bearing sins of the past, for the future is taken

War, born of strife, these trials persuade us not (Feel what? Learn what?)
Words, without sound, these lies betray our thoughts
Mired by a plague of doubt, the land, she mourns (See what? Hear what?)
Judgement binds all we hold to a memory of scorn
Tell us why, given Life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?

Answer (look) Answer (think) Answer together

Thy life is a riddle to bear rapture and sorrow
To listen, to suffer, to entrust unto tomorrow
In one fleeting moment, from the land doth life flow
Yet in one fleeting moment, for anew it doth grow
In the same fleeting moment
Thou must live
Die
And know
